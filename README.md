## ✨ Features

- 🌎 ```Smart AI Translations``` — Powered by **Groq AI** (Llama 3.3 70B for translation/suggestion, Qwen3-32B for explanations), offering natural, native-like results with multiple alternatives.  
- 💡 ```Expression Suggestions``` — Get idiomatic expressions with translations and alternative phrasings.  
- 📖 ```Explanations Mode``` — Learn the **origin, meaning, nuance, and tone** of an expression with **3 real-world examples**.  
- 🗣️ ```Voice Input``` — Speak directly to request translations.  
- 🕵️ ```Auto Language Detection``` — Automatically detects source language.  
- 🔐 ```User Accounts``` — Login with **Google OAuth** and persistent session with **JWT**.
- 🗄️ ```History & Favorite``` — Store translations and suggestions in history or favorites.  
- 🌐 ```Choose Explanation Language``` — Control the language used for expression explanations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. ```Translate``` — Enter text (or speak) → Groq returns natural translations + alternatives. Voice input is transcribed via Groq Whisper.  
2. ```Suggest``` — Request an expression → Groq provides idioms with translation + alternatives.  
3. ```Explain``` — Ask for context → Groq explains the expression’s origin, nuance, and tone with **3 real usage examples**.  
4. ```Save``` — Logged-in users can save results to **history** or **favorites** for later.  
5. ```Learn``` — Explanations can be delivered in the user’s preferred language.

## 🖥️ Deployment

- Self-hosted on a `Hetzner VPS` using `Docker` for containerized deployment  
- `Nginx` as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the app containers  
- `Certbot` is used to issue and automatically renew SSL certificates for HTTPS  
- `Cloudflare` for CDN, caching, and additional security protection  
- Monorepo structure: most front-end logic lives in `/packages` to prepare for an upcoming `React Native` version  
- Deployment is fully containerized and scalable, allowing easy updates and maintenance


---

## ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline

Traduxo uses a **self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** on the server (managed via `systemd`) to handle continuous integration and deployment.  

The pipeline is triggered on:

- Pushes to `main` branch  
- Pull requests targeting `main` (only the test branch would be triggered on pull requests)  
- Manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`)

---

### 1️⃣ Test Job
- Runs on the self-hosted runner  
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code  
  2. Build the Docker test image (`nextjs/Dockerfile.test`)  
  3. Run linting and Jest unit tests inside the container  
  4. Remove the test image after completion  

This ensures that only code passing tests proceeds to deployment.

---

### 2️⃣ Deploy Job
- Runs **only on pushes to `main`** and depends on the `test` job  
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code  
  2. Log in to Docker Hub using secrets  
  3. Build the production Docker image (`nextjs/Dockerfile.prod`) with required build arguments  
  4. Push the Docker image to Docker Hub  
  5. SSH into the Hetzner server and perform deployment:
     - Backup the current container (`docker tag traduxo-app:latest traduxo-app:backup`)  
     - Pull the new image via `docker compose pull`  
     - Run Prisma migrations in a temporary container  
     - If migrations succeed, bring up the new version (`docker compose up -d`)  
     - Remove dangling images (`docker image prune -f`)  
     - If migrations fail, rollback to the backup image  

---

### 🔑 Notes
- All operations run inside Docker, ensuring consistent environments  
- The pipeline uses **secrets** for sensitive data like Docker Hub credentials, server SSH keys, and API base URLs
- Using self-hosted runner because server architecture is **ARM64**, avoiding slow build times with buildx or QEMU on GitHub Actions cloud runners

## 🏗️ Local Developer Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run Traduxo locally for development.

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JordanDonguy/traduxo.git
    cd traduxo
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
    cp nextjs/.env.example nextjs/.env.development
```

Then edit the files to set your environment variables

### 3️⃣ Start Development Containers
```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This will start:

- PostgreSQL  
- Traduxo app container  

### 4️⃣ View Application Logs
```bash
    docker logs -f traduxo-app-1
```

### 5️⃣ Run Tests & Lint

Inside /nextjs, there is a Dockerfile.test configured to run tests and linting:
```bash
    # Build and run the test container
    docker build -f nextjs/Dockerfile.test -t traduxo-test .
    docker run --rm traduxo-test
```

- `--rm` ensures the container is removed after running  
- This will execute Jest tests and linting in an isolated environment  

If you want to remove the test image after:
```bash
    docker rmi -f traduxo-test
```

### 6️⃣ Access the App

Once containers are running, the app should be available at:
```bash
    http://localhost:3000
```

### ✅ Notes

- Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running  
- Any changes to .env files require restarting the containers

## 📱 Mobile App (React Native)

Traduxo also includes a fully working **React Native mobile app**, offering the same core features as the web version, powered by the same shared codebase.

The mobile app is **not published on the App Store or Play Store yet**, but you can run it locally using **Expo Go**:

### 🔧 Run the Mobile App Locally

1. Install **Expo Go** on your device

   * iOS: App Store → *Expo Go*
   * Android: Play Store → *Expo Go*

2. Clone the repository and start the mobile project:

```bash
cd react_native
npm install
npm start
```

3. Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal or browser using the **Expo Go app**.
